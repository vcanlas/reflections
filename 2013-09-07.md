I thought that the first week of class was really interesting. I haven't had the exposure to all these things we began talking about like virtual machines and what not. When I installed the programs on my laptop, I was actually feeling afraid I would mess up since the instructions didn't really give detailed step-by-step details on how to do things. I guess this is one of the blocks I had during the week--not knowing exactly what to do. I was used to following instructions, especially when setting up new things. Anyway, the group discussion where we tried to solve each other's concerns was a nice way to really diversify the knowledge of what other people knew and what you didn't. It shows proof how collaboration really helps us in different ways.
