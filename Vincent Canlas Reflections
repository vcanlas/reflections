Being someone who doesn't have coding experience whatsoever, it was difficult to start working on the data provided.
I felt lost for a little bit, with setting up my virtual machine + server + ipython and whatever else was told
for us to do. Also, setting up a time to do a homework due in less than a week was rather difficult. We were 
expected to work on it on a weekend, signaling that we should be able free that weekend. Other classes usually provide
ample time to do such projects. It was frustrating at times that this is the case and we are left with no choice. For
my specific case, since I was the curator and I had zero idea on how to get started with iPython using my VM, it was
difficult and a team member of time did the curating part since he had knowledge of python/ipython. I think next time,
we should be either playing on each other's strengths, or at least give more time to actually learn a new program, 
before diving in to a group project like this.

## Sept. 28, 2013: What are your thoughts on reproducibility? For it or against it? 
### _What logical reasons do you have to be for it or against it?_ _What is the strongest justification for the opposite view?_
I asked for helped... finally. I know that this course talks a lot about collaboration, and I did that so I finally
actually figured out how to do this 'pull request' thing. Just a feedback on the course, before I talk about my
thoughts on reproducibility, I think that it should be clearer -- in steps, on how to do such basic things. Yes, I agree
there are some things we can research on our own etc, but there is also a level of expectation to let us know about
the basics, especially for new platforms like Github.
As I mentioned somewhere else, I believe that reproducibility isn't a bad thing. For some people it works, for
some people it doesn't. Unfortunately, I am not a big fan of it at this stage since I am not a researcher
not a good performer in this technology space. However, I know I benefit from it. For example, as I was taking
Stat 133 and performing a lot of tasks in R, I benefited from this community where people are contributing to
the stackoverflow space--they placed work there which is reproducible. In that sense, I am for it. However, the
caveat I see as to why I would  be against this is that work can sometimes be exposed and used by others for personal
financial benefit. Someone could be doing work for profit, but taking work that is publicly placed and is reproducible.
Unless things posted online are copyrighted, these work are vulnerable for abuse. The strongest justification as to
why this is awesome and great is that it does produce a great amount of resources for others for the betterment of our 
communit. People who continuously chip in to ideas and work will definitely help whatever they're trying to do--whether
that be helping improve medicine and healthcare, or fixing certain problems like poverty--where the end goal is really
great, we can definitely see the great value of reproducibility and collaboration in this sense.

The guest speakers this week were engaging in that I could recall the things that I learned from taking Stat
134 and 135. The terminologies, the theories, the tests that were all a bunch of... terminologies, theories, and tests
are now being seen as things that are actually used with data, in real life situations. This is what I am interested
in--utilizing what I learn in class for real world applications. I am stoked to hear about our project and the work
that the speakers do. As a guiding light though for this week, I am still confused as to what we are doing in this class.
I know the programs/languages we're using since you basically told us to download a bunch of things, but it is not helpful
at all that we don't have anything to look back on here on github (or bspace... or anywhere else). I think it is
difficult for collaboration to occur with our peers at this point since we all have different expectations
and commitments and for someone like me who does a lot of campus, work, and school--it is difficult to provide
feedback to others and obtain those feedback and would probably be more beneficial if we had something to look at
through online space like github. I know we just talked about feedback and input last week, so it'd be great
to see those changes implemented. As far as this week goes, it was great to see a refresher so I can't wait to 
actually work.

I thought that the class on Thursday for this week was somewhat productive, but I personally feel that things like these
should be done some place else (i.e. a survey). Although I understand that this is a non-traditional course, I agree
with most of my peers that this class needs somewhat more of a direction. End goals were set in the beginning
and I think that's where most of the excitement is for this course. There's a lot of ideas, wants, thoughts for this class
but I personally feel that a direction for things we do would be great. I do not have a lot of programming experience,
as a matter of fact I only know R and basic HTML. Those are languages that I am familiar with, so for example,
Github is something new to me. Posting a reflection this way is "complicated." Perhaps it's because it's new to me
and it will make more sense later. But I feel like to go along with what I said earlier, it'd be great to actually
tell us to type our reflection by clicking the readme.md, etc. This way, for those of us who are starters, we have
that sense of direction.

I thought that the first week of class was really interesting. I haven't had the exposure to all these things
we began talking about like virtual machines and what not. When I installed the programs on my laptop, 
I was actually feeling afraid I would mess up since the instructions didn't really give detailed step-by-step 
details on how to do things. I guess this is one of the blocks I had during the week--not knowing exactly what to do. 
I was used to following instructions, especially when setting up new things. Anyway, the group discussion where we 
tried to solve each other's concerns was a nice way to really diversify the knowledge of what other people knew and 
what you didn't. It shows proof how collaboration really helps us in different ways.
